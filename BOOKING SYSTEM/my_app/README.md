# Hotel Reservation System
This is a full-stack hotel reservation system built using React for the front end, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The system allows users to search for and book hotel rooms based on their desired check-in and check-out dates, and displays the available rooms and their respective prices.

# Motivation
The project was created out of a passion for coding and an interest in developing full-stack applications. The goal was to build a hotel reservation system from scratch without using a state management tool like Redux.

# Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to build this project:

React: for the front-end user interface
Node.js: for the server-side logic and API endpoints
MongoDB: for the database
Express: for building the server and creating API endpoints
Bootstrap: for responsive and modern styling

# Features
The hotel reservation system includes the following features:

User authentication: users can create an account and log in to view their reservations
Search functionality: users can search for hotel rooms based on their desired check-in and check-out dates
Room availability: the system displays available rooms and their prices based on the selected check-in and check-out dates
Reservation management: users can view, modify, and cancel their reservations
Email notifications: users receive email notifications for reservation confirmations and cancellations
# Usage
To use the hotel reservation system, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README files for both the front-end and back-end applications.

# Future Improvements
Future improvements to the hotel reservation system could include the following:

Adding payment processing functionality
Integrating with a third-party API for real-time room availability and pricing
Adding support for multiple hotels and locations
