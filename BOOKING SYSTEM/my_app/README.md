# Hotel Reservation System
This is a full-stack hotel reservation system built using React for the front end, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The system allows users to search for and book hotel rooms based on their desired check-in and check-out dates, and displays the available rooms and their respective prices.

# Motivation
The project was created out of a passion for coding and an interest in developing full-stack applications. The goal was to build a hotel reservation system from scratch without using a state management tool like Redux.

# Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to build this project:

1. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" alt="React Logo" width="50px"/> for the front-end user interface
2. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg" alt="Node.js Logo" width="50px"/> for the server-side logic and API endpoints
3. <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/mongodb/mongodb-icon.svg" alt="MongoDB Logo" width="50px"/> for the database
4. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Expressjs.png" alt="Express Logo" width="50px"/> for building the server and creating API endpoints
5. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Bootstrap_logo.svg/1200px-Bootstrap_logo.svg.png" alt="Bootstrap Logo" width="50px"/> for responsive and modern styling


# Features

1. User authentication: users can create an account and log in to view their reservations
2. Search functionality: users can search for hotel rooms based on their desired check-in and check-out dates
3. Room availability: the system displays available rooms and their prices based on the selected check-in and check-out dates
4. Reservation management: users can view, modify, and cancel their reservations
5. Email notifications: users receive email notifications for reservation confirmations and cancellations
# Usage
To use the hotel reservation system, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README files for both the front-end and back-end applications.

# Future Improvements
Future improvements to the hotel reservation system could include the following:

Adding payment processing functionality
Integrating with a third-party API for real-time room availability and pricing
Adding support for multiple hotels and locations
